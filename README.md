I chose Assignment #1 because it allows me to showcase my design pattern understanding. The code uses the Decorator pattern to add features like logging while maintaining clean and flexible code.
The Decorator pattern enables adding new features without altering existing code, ensuring easy extension and organized code structure.

**Example Usage**
1. Create notification providers: Set up providers for email and push notifications.
2. Add logging functionality: Use decorators to add logging capabilities to the providers.
3. Send notifications: Utilize the decorated providers to send notifications effectively.
